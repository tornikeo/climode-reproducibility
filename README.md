This repository attempts to replicate the ClimODE model's results. 

The base repository is at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/ClimODE. 

# Running this

Please refer to the [documentation](./docs/on_vastai.md) on running. 

Experiments were done on hardware rented on [vast.ai](https://vast.ai/). 

At minimum, you will need one RTX4090 GPU with 24GBs VRAM and at least 32GB of RAM. The dataset, the packages and the experiments only used up to 50GB of disk space in total.
