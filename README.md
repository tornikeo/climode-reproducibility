# ClimODE replication

**This repo contains [ClimODE](https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/ClimODE) as a submodule**. Clone appropriately.

Some notes:

About notebooks:

1. By default all notebooks are ignored. Write all you want here, and make sure you can "see" files around you. Use `!pwd` to see where you are located.
1. When you write a notebook good enough to be shared around (commented and useful), use `git add -f notes/yournotebookbook.ipynb` to add it.

About python:

1. All python stored in `climode`, as top level files, to be imported as `from climode import myfile`

About report (tex):

1. Stored under `report`.

About all else:

1. Data, Model files, zips, images, pdfs, all go into assets.
